  <section class="article-entry">
    <p>2021 is a hard year. It is defintely a turning point of my life. Pressures come from all aspects. Over the year, I’ve felt defeated, helpless, incompetent, meaningless and bright. I am not going to disclose the details here. But all of those difficulties waked me up. They informed me how I need to change and what abilities for me to improve. I prefer not to suspect it’s something wrong with the world. Rather, I know, it’s <strong>myself</strong> to evolve further. </p>
<p>I want to summarize what I want to achieve in 2022 in this post. I will go through them at the end of each month for at least 12 times, so I won’t forget and get lost in the middle of 2022. I’d like to go with two big directions: <strong>career growth</strong> and <strong>personal growth</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Career-Growth"><a href="#Career-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Career Growth"></a>Career Growth</h2><h3 id="1-Branding-yourself"><a href="#1-Branding-yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Branding yourself"></a>1. Branding yourself</h3><p>The achievement that comes under your name is your best wealth. It belongs to you forever. You can prove your abilities to others in any stage of your life, and also it can be improved anytime when you want. The work you’ve done for company is vague to others and you can’t optimize it after you left. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Keep Updating Blogs</em></strong></p>
<p>  When you have anything want to share, just squezze some time writing them down and posting here. It may need a lot of time researching, thinking, organizing, but it definitely worth it. You are able to train your researching skill, teaching skill and writing skill, let alone it can serve as a lightspot on your resume.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Open Source Projects</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk is cheap, show me the code. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  As an engineer, coding ability is the basic. You won’t be able to understand those complex design patterns, complex systems, architectures without writing a considerable amount of code.</p>
<p>  Build something useful and make it open source. Write complete document, teach others how to use it. Let others raise issues. Optimize over time. Let it shine for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Relationships"><a href="#2-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="2. Relationships"></a>2. Relationships</h3><p>Don’t be shy and intimidated. Get yourself more exposure to your team, to your sister team, to your clients, to your organization, to your company, and to the public. Get out of your comfort zone and make friends with people. They are another treasure in your life. </p>
<p>They can provide you information you don’t have. They can help you out when you stuck. They will be the indispensable force for you to promote, even the referrer when you’re looking for an opportunity. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Connect With People From Different Areas/Levels</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Different people have different viewpoints towards projects, companies, industries and markets. The data points from only engineers won’t be more complete and objective than the combined ones from SDEs, SDMs, PMs, TPMs and leaders altogether. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Getting While Giving</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ask them questions, while also try to give insights when possible. Relationship is healthier when the information flows bi-directionally. People don’t like someone only ask questions but outputing nothing. This also requires another base – to be able to give – you have to know a lot too.</p>
<h3 id="3-Interview-skills"><a href="#3-Interview-skills" class="headerlink" title="3. Interview skills"></a>3. Interview skills</h3><p>Don’t overlook this one when you feel comfortable at your office seat. Your mind is changing, your life is changing, your company is changing, the industry you’re in is changing too. <strong>The world is changing is the only thing that never changes.</strong> Get yourself prepared with interviews, inject more flexibility into your life. </p>
<p>Get inteviewed from time to time has another benefit – it helps you know the labor market. You can know if there is new skill sets needed, if there is new technology/solution/rival that may take over your project/company gradually, and importantly – if the salary for your current position is outdated.</p>
<p>Inteview skills are something can degenerate with time if you don’t practice it. It does need a lot of time to construct, but once you master it, you just need small amount of time to keep it fresh. The key is don’t be lazy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Coding Problems</em></strong></p>
<p>  Are you still familiar with the essense of following? No? Try to read Java Source code and implement them yourself.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong><em>System Design</em></strong></p>
<p>  There are more and more interview questions related to system design, especially when your level goes up. Are you comfortable with them and grasp everything like you do for coding problem? </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Be an Interviewer</em></strong></p>
<p>  Try to interview others, you should be able to learn more about interview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-Communication-skills"><a href="#4-Communication-skills" class="headerlink" title="4. Communication skills"></a>4. Communication skills</h3><p>Communication is one of my bottleneck. It limited a person to all kinds of areas.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Practice Speaking</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Be confluent</strong>, you can speak slower but clearer. <strong>Be organized</strong>, you should have a picture of what you’re gonna present while you’re speaking. <strong>Be confident</strong>, speak with enough volume that others can hear you, and don’t be afraid to be wrong. <strong>Try to grasp and create opportunity to practice</strong>. It can be a morning standup, a design meeting, a requirement clarification, a presentation, etc. Remember your goal when involving in daily activites!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Speak Informatively</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t speak things that have no information. <strong>First</strong>, you must have and know the information you want to talk about. <strong>Second</strong>, keep succinct with main sentence, expand with necessary examples and explanation from listener’s feedback. <strong>Third</strong>, summarize with your key points, keep others impressive with your information and your mind-set.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Social Knowledge</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t immerse in tech topics only. Get your self updated with latest social topics, including tech companies, trends, economics, movies and shows, etc. And don’t stop on the surface, but get some insights from these topics. Everybody will know some news, but insights and opinions keep the conversation going on and being valuable.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tech-stack"><a href="#5-Tech-stack" class="headerlink" title="5. Tech stack"></a>5. Tech stack</h3><p>As an engineer, if you want to be a senior, a tech lead, a principal, even CTO, you have to have very solid tech knowledges to help the company and also convince others.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Dive deep!</em></strong></p>
<p>  Know how to use a tool is a necessity. But what differentiates you from others is how deep you understand the tool. There are tons of engieers graduating from college all over the world everyday. They can learn and will learn to use tech faster than you. You have to go deeper so as to stand out in the labor market. You should be able to solve the problem that others aren’t able to solve.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Java</em></strong></p>
<p>  <strong>Reading source code</strong>, understand the code that used by the whole world. It helps when writing your own code. <strong>Learning JVM</strong>, it’s the key to debug bottleneck of a system writing in Java. <strong>Concurrency programming</strong>, concurrency level is a key indicator to judge if a project is big enough. It’s hard, while you have to be able to solve such problems when you have more impacts. And a lot of issues won’t emerge if the TPS is too low.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Golang</em></strong></p>
<p>  Go is a language especially better for handling concurrency. A lot of containerization tools are written with Go. Microservice and container must be adopted by more people overtime. And, how long didn’t you learn a new language? <strong>Grasp go like you do for Java!</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Docker/Kubernates</em></strong></p>
<p>  Docker and k18s currently is the most used tool for microservice and containerization. Learn it!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Spring Framework</em></strong></p>
<p>  Amazon uses Coral and a list of internal tools to build microservice, while spring may be the most popular framework outside the Amazon world. Learn spring, and compare it with what you’re using now!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Kafka and Redis</em></strong></p>
<p>  Now that you have so many knowledge of languages, frameworks and tools, you should be able to dig into the real systems that can handle high TPS. Kafka and Redis are good representatives in this area. Learn it deeply and understand how they achieve such a performance!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>and more</em></strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-Leadership"><a href="#7-Leadership" class="headerlink" title="7. Leadership"></a>7. Leadership</h3><p>Consciously give constructing opinions to your peers, team and organization. Your goal is to be a leader, not a lifetime indivual contributor. Try to train such things from the very beginning. It’s late when you’re already a leader. Examine if your decision is the same as current leadership. The good thing is that you don’t take any risks when you’re not a leader but you can learn from it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Answer and Solve Questions/Issues From Team</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Your team is the closest chance for you to train your leadership. Your manager/teammates will listen to what you said everyday. You can get direct feedback from them on the situation and your idea. <strong>Learn and make impact starting within your team.</strong> This is the best way to correct your mindset and train your leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Read Documents From Your Leadership</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the easiest way to peek into the mind of your leaders. They will explain bigger problems, talk about all kinds of solutions, making detailed trade offs, and getting decisions in the doc. Collect and organize the docs from your leaders, read them carefully.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Ask Your Manager For Information</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Typically your manager is the shielding layer for you to errands outside your team. Therefore, if you want to know more about the organization, ask such exposure and opportunity from your manager.</p>
<h3 id="8-Foreseeing"><a href="#8-Foreseeing" class="headerlink" title="8. Foreseeing"></a>8. Foreseeing</h3><ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Keep Track of News</em></strong></p>
<p>  Get updated with what’s going on in the world. Don’t just get locked at your own circle. Be open minded, you can dislike some techs/companies, but you should understand why and how they become a hot topic. Sometimes even with more understanding, you’ll love them too. Bitcoin, block chain, NFT, metaverse, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Thinking About Future</em></strong></p>
<p>  Imagine what the future will be, it’s not next month, next half of the year, but 3 years later, 5 years later, 10 years later, 20 years later. What will be the top 10 most used languages in the world? What will be the most viewed websites (Google? tictoks? or some other apps?) Will everybody uses cloud computing? Will AWS still be the leading role in the market (Azure, GCP, Aliyun?) Use your knowledge, collect information, anaylize the society, think big and guess boldly. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Working Towards Future</em></strong></p>
<p>  Spend time to learn the trends, don’t get outdated from the society. Keep your knowledge fresh and making yourself a hotspot in labor market. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Personal Finance</li>
<li>Knowledge breadth</li>
<li>Be focus</li>
<li>Keep thinking, deep</li>
