    <p>2021 is a hard year. It is defintely a turning point of my life. Pressures come from all aspects. Over the year, I’ve felt defeated, helpless, incompetent, meaningless and bright. I am not going to disclose the details here. But all of those difficulties waked me up. They informed me how I need to change and what abilities for me to improve. I prefer not to suspect if it’s something wrong with the world. Rather, I know, it’s <strong>myself</strong> to evolve further. </p>
<p>I want to summarize what I want to achieve in 2022 in this post. I will go through them at the end of each month for 12 times, so I won’t forget and get lost. I’d like to go with two big direction: <strong>career growth</strong> and <strong>personal growth</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Career-Growth"><a href="#Career-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Career Growth"></a>Career Growth</h2><h3 id="1-Branding-yourself"><a href="#1-Branding-yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Branding yourself"></a>1. Branding yourself</h3><p>The achievement that comes under your name is your best wealth. It belongs to you forever. You can use it to prove your ability to others in any stage of your life, and also it can be improved anytime when you want. The work you did for company is not vague to others and you can’t change it after you left. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Keep Updating Blogs</p>
<p>  When you have anything want to share with other, just find some time writing them down and posting here. It may need a lot of time researching, thinking, organizing, but it definitely worth it. You are able to improve your research skill, teaching skill and writing skill, let alone it can serve as a lightspot on your resume.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Open Source Projects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk is cheap, show me the code. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  As an engineer, coding ability is the basic. You won’t be able to understand those complex design patterns, complex systems, architectures without a considerable amount of code.</p>
<p>  Build something useful and open source it. Make complete document, teach others how to use it. Let others raise issues. Let it shine for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
