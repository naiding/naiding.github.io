  <section class="article-entry">
    <p>2021 is a hard year. It is defintely a turning point of my life. Pressures come from all aspects. Over the year, I’ve felt defeated, helpless, incompetent, meaningless and bright. I am not going to disclose the details here. But all of those difficulties waked me up. They informed me how I need to change and what abilities for me to improve. I prefer not to suspect it’s something wrong with the world. Rather, I know, it’s <strong>myself</strong> to evolve further. </p>
<p>I want to summarize what I want to achieve in 2022 in this post. I will go through them at the end of each month for at least 12 times, so I won’t forget and get lost in the middle of 2022. I’d like to go with two big directions: <strong>career growth</strong> and <strong>personal growth</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Career-Growth"><a href="#Career-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Career Growth"></a>Career Growth</h2><h3 id="1-Branding-yourself"><a href="#1-Branding-yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Branding yourself"></a>1. Branding yourself</h3><p>The achievement that comes under your name is your best wealth. It belongs to you forever. You can use it to prove your ability to others in any stage of your life, and also it can be improved anytime when you want. The work you did for company is vague to others and you can’t change it after you left. </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Keep Updating Blogs</em></strong></p>
<p>  When you have anything want to share with other, just find some time writing them down and posting here. It may need a lot of time researching, thinking, organizing, but it definitely worth it. You are able to improve your researching skill, teaching skill and writing skill, let alone it can serve as a lightspot on your resume.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong><em>Open Source Projects</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talk is cheap, show me the code. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  As an engineer, coding ability is the basic. You won’t be able to understand those complex design patterns, complex systems, architectures without writing a considerable amount of code.</p>
<p>  Build something useful and make it open source. Write complete document, teach others how to use it. Let others raise issues. Let it shine for you.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Relationships"><a href="#2-Relationships" class="headerlink" title="2. Relationships"></a>2. Relationships</h3><p>Don’t be shy and intimidated. Get yourself more exposure to your team, to your sister team, to your clients, to your organization, to your company, and to the public. Get out of your comfort zone and make friends with people. They are another treasure in your life. </p>
<p>They can provide you information you don’t have. They can help you out when you stuck. They will be the indispensable force for you to promote. And, even the referrer when you’re looking for an opportunity. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Connect With People From Different Levels</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Different people have different viewpoints of project, company, industry, market, etc. The data points from only engineers won’t be more complete and objective than the ones from SDEs, SDMs, PMs, TPMs and up leaders together. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Getting While Giving</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Ask them questions, while also try to give when possible. Relationship is healthier when the information flows bi-directional. People don’t like someone only ask questions but output nothing. But this also gives another requirement, to be able to give, you have to know a lot too.</p>
<h3 id="3-Interview-skills"><a href="#3-Interview-skills" class="headerlink" title="3. Interview skills"></a>3. Interview skills</h3><p>Don’t overlook this one when you feel comfortable at your office seat. Your mind is changing, your life is changing, your company is changing, the industry you’re in is changing. <strong>The world is changing is the only thing that never change.</strong> Get yourself prepared with interviews, inject more flexibility into your life. </p>
<p>Get inteviewed from time to time has another benefit – it helps you know the labor market. You can know if there is new skill sets needed, if there is new technology/solution that may take over your project/company, also if the salary for your position is outdated.</p>
<p>Inteview skills are something can degenerate with time if you don’t practice it. It does need a lot of time to onboard, but once you master it, you just need small amount of time to keep it fresh. The key is don’t be lazy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Coding Problems</em></strong></p>
<p>  Are you still familiar with the essense of following?</p>
<table>

</li>
<li><p><strong><em>System Design</em></strong></p>
<p>  There are more and more interview questions related to system design. Are you comfortable with them and grasp everything like you do for coding problem?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Be an Interviewer</em></strong></p>
<p>  Try to interview others, you should be able to learn more about interview.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-Communication-skills"><a href="#4-Communication-skills" class="headerlink" title="4. Communication skills"></a>4. Communication skills</h3><p>Communication is one of my bottleneck. It limited a person for all kinds of area.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Practice Speaking</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Be confluent</strong>, you can speak slower but clearer.<br><strong>Be organized</strong>, you should have a picture of what you’re gonna present while you’re speaking. <strong>Be confident</strong>, speak with a volume that others can hear you, and don’t be afraid to be wrong. <strong>Try to grash every opportunity to practice</strong>. It can be a morning standup, a design meeting, a requirement clarification, a presentation, etc. Remember your goal when doing such daily activity!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Speak Informatively</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t speak things that have no information. <strong>First</strong>, you must have and know the information to present. <strong>Second</strong>, keep succinct with main sentence, expand with necessary examples and explanation from listener’s feedback. <strong>Third</strong>, summarize with your key points, keep others impressive with your information.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Social Knowledge</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t immerse in tech topics only. Get your self updated with latest social topics, including tech companies, trends, economics, movies and shows, etc. And don’t stop at the surface, but get some insights from these news. Everybody could know the news, but insights and opinions keep the conversation going on.</p>
<h3 id="5-Tech-stack"><a href="#5-Tech-stack" class="headerlink" title="5. Tech stack"></a>5. Tech stack</h3><p>As an engineer, if you want to be a senior, a tech lead, a principal, even CTO, you have to have a very solid tech knowledge to help with the company and convince others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dive deep!</li>
<li>Java: reading source code(java, netty, etc), learning JVM tuning, and concurrency programming</li>
<li>Go: another language to the future</li>
<li>Docker/Kubernates</li>
<li>Spring/Microservice</li>
<li>Kafka</li>
<li>Redis</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="6-Foreseeing"><a href="#6-Foreseeing" class="headerlink" title="6. Foreseeing"></a>6. Foreseeing</h3><ul>
<li>Keep track of news</li>
<li>Thinking about future</li>
<li>Working towards future</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Personal-Growth"><a href="#Personal-Growth" class="headerlink" title="Personal Growth"></a>Personal Growth</h2><ul>
<li>Personal Finance</li>
<li>Knowledge breadth</li>
<li>Be focus</li>
<li>Keep thinking, deep</li>
<li>Get a strong body</li>
